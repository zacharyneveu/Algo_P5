This project solves mazes read from a file.  Part A uses either a recursive or
stack-based DFS to find a path from the top-left to bottom-right corner of the
maze.  Part B introduces BFS and Dijkstra's algorithm to ensure that the
shortest path is found, instead of just finding any path.

USAGE: Compile and run.  Choose which algorithm you would like to use.  Next,
choose whether or not you would like graphical output.  Graphical output will
print the maze with symbols for initial square, target square, and current
square at every step, in addition to the directions of each move.  Choosing to
omit graphical output will only print the directions of each move.
